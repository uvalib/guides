Ratio Keylines
==================

> Images can be scaled with CSS to look the same across different screen
resolutions by using the following recommended aspect ratios:

 - 16:9
 - 3:2
 - 4:3
 - 1:1
 - 3:4
 - 2:3

**Note: The format I wrote the ratios is 'width:height'**

For example:

 - A 1:1 aspect ratio means an element has equal height and width.
 - A 360px wide image with a 2:3 aspect ratio has a height of 540px

Determine the width or height of your element for a chosen aspect ratio using the below formulas. The aspect ratio is always expressed as a fraction. For example, 3:2 is treated as 3/2.


Width = Aspect ratio * Height
Height = Width/Aspect ratio
